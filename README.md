## Challenge Objective
- Find key statistical data for month of June and December

## Challenge Findings
- The average temperature in June and December are very similar, with temperature of June around 75F, and temperature of December around 71
- It is a nice place to visit all year around, just a little bit advantage in weather temperature when visiting in summer

## Further analysis recommendations
- Instead of analyze staticstical data in specific month, the result would be more accurate and convincing if we expand the date period from a single month to a quarter. For example, analyze the entire summer session(June-August) and winder holiday season(November-January).
- Deep dive in to the precipitation for each hours in a day in June and December and compare the difference. We would have better inventory control over the amount of visitors during a day if we know the difference of precipitation.
